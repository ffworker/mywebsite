# README
# THIS REPO IS MAINLY A DOCUMENTATION FOR MYSELF //

this does not include everything I am working on. It just shows a variety of different software I used so far

I am not an expert on those projects, everything you see is a result of looking trough documentations and/or user experiences (stackoverflow mainly)

Basically using this website to create a short overview about my projects and how to install them on a very basic level. 

# In-Depth Configurations are not documented, yet
